# MinFS
MinFS is a fuse driver for Minio and S3 storage backends. Currently we can list the files, retrieve files. When modifying files, they will be only modified in the cache folder.

[BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) is being used for caching and saving metadata, like file listings, permissions, owners and such. Each folder will have its own Bolt bucket where the contents of the folders are placed into.

The cache folder is being used for the BoltDB cache database and the files being cached or modified. It will be always possible to remove the cache folder and cache database. Be careful that MinFS has synchronised the data to the storage. The cache folder will be recreated.

Files that are modified will be queued and uploaded to storage.

## Working

The following features are roughly working at the moment:

* list folders and subfolders
* open and read files
* create new files (not being uploaded to storage yet, only cache)
* modify existing files (not being uploaded to storage yet, only cache)
* move and rename of files
* upload of files
* delete files
* change permissions

## Build

```
$ go get github.com/minio/minfs
$ go build -o /usr/bin/minfs
```

## Installation

```
$ ln -s /usr/bin/minfs /usr/sbin/mount.minfs
```

## Mount

### Authenticated

```
$ MINFS_ACCESS=... MINFS_SECRET=... mount -t minfs -o gid=0,uid=0,cache=./cache/ http://172.16.84.1:9000/asiatrip /hello
```

### Anonymous

```
$ mount -t minfs -o gid=0,uid=0,cache=./cache/ http://172.16.84.1:9000/asiatrip /hello
```

## Unmount

```
$ umount /hello
```

## Options

* **GID**: The default gid to assign for files from storage.
* **UID**: The default gid to assign for files from storage.
* **Cache**: Location for cache folder.
* **Path**: The root path in the bucket
* **Debug**: Enables debug logs

## Read

Every operation the latest version will be retrieved. We don't have a method of verifying if the file
has been changed on the provider, so this is the safest and will work in most cases.

## Write

When a **dirty** file has been closed, it will be uploaded to the bucket, when the file is 
completely uploaded it will be unlocked.

## Locking

The locking mechanism is very defensive, only one operation is allowed at a time. This prevents
issues with synchronization and keeps the fuse driver simple.

## Frequently asked questions

* if you cannot unmount, try seeing what files are open on the mount. `lsof |grep mount`

## Debugging

We've added a sleep to the upload, this allows us to test the locking mechanism.

## Scenarios

* create a file
* append to a file
* make directory
* remove empty directory 
* remove directory with contents
* rename file
* move file into different directory
* move directory with contents
* check locked file

## Todo

There is a long list of todos:

* allow stats to be printed using a signal
* use local cache folder, for most used files. Do we want to register / cache this info in a bolt db?
* use Minio notifications to actively update metadata 
* one mountpoint per bucket
* each mountpoint will have its own cache folders and can be mounted to one bucket
* use minio configs? .minfs file for keys?
* implement encryption support, (a)symmetric
+ implement base path
* implement support for cancel context
* mount readonly?
